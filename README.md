# This is a simple software for showing how you can easily create an API for Kotlin + Integration tests + Unit tests

In this API we use the following libraries:

- Javalin -> for creating and embedded HTTP server and handle the requests in a simple and lightweight manner
- KotlinX JSON Serialization -> for transforming Kotlin objets into JSON strings and vice versa
- JUnit -> for tests


This software uses Gradle for managing dependencies (our used libraries).


You can easily run this code through IntelliJ Community (free edition) IDE.
